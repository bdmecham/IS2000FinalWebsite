                    My name is Adam Maxwell. I'm a Computer Science major, Electronics Technology minor currently attending
                    Southern Utah University. The reason I went into this field was because I enjoy computers and being able
                    to make them do what I want.

                    Something interesting about me is that I own a 1977 Corvette that I'm almost done restoring. I really enjoy 
                    working on cars with my dad.

                    My hobbies include 3d printing, working on cars, programming, and spending time with my wife.
