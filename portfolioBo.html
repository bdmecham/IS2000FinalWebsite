                <p style="font-size: 17px;">My name is Bo Stevens. I'm a third year Computer Science student at Southern Utah University. I specialize in game design.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">I've worked on a couple projects while at school. Recently, I've been very proud of my work in Unreal Engine 4. It's kind of been a pet project of mine to learn a 3D game engine this semester, and I've been doing really well so far. I'm far from professional yet, but I'm extremely proud that I've come a step closer to my dream.
				<br>
				<br>
				I grew up in a small town in the middle of Utah. Never really had a lot of opportunities in life to do something special, which is why, when I went to university, I decided to put everything I had into it. There wasn't a whole lot for me to go back to, so I decided that I would always be pushing forward instead. It's served me well these past years and I've done things I never would have thought possible of myself. Every single little thing has been an enormous struggle, but knowing that every day I come a step closer to overcoming that challenge makes me incredibly proud.
                <br>
				<br>
				I have experience in Java, C++, UnrealScript, SQL, Swift, and Swing. I've made projects with each of these languages and feel comfortable using them on a daily basis. 
				<br>
				I love making video games. It's what I've spent the last four years of my life dedicating myself to. However, I do have plenty of other talents and hobbies as well. I often don't have much time for it anymore, but I shoot stock photography in my spare time. My photos have been seen by millions of people around the world. I also enjoy shooting and editing video. Specifically, I'm a real sucker for cinematography. I love lining up a good shot. When I'm feeling less productive, I also love to cook. And finally, when I want to relax, I spend my afternoons on my longboard, listening to music as coast down the emptying city streets.
				<br>
				<br>
				As far as professional experience goes, I've spent the past year working as a computer science tutor/grader. It's my responsibility to teach students topics ranging from Intro to Programming to Alogrithms and Data Structures. As January 2020, I have been promoted to head tutor where I also carry the responsibility of managing my team while also being a constant backup member for anyone who's struggling to get across an idea with a student. I honestly love my work. I get to see lightbulbs go off in people's heads almost every day. I've had previous management experience as a shift supervisor at Costa Vida for about a year before I moved to college. I've also worked in home security as a remote assistance technician. I'm an incredibly hard and motivated worker.
