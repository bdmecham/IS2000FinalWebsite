                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Bryce Mecham. I am 20 years old, and I am currently a senior at Southern Utah University studying Computer Science. 
                    I really love to program, my current favorite is Python just of how easy it is to write something quickly. 
                    I would love to learn more Javascript and get into making more web content or learn a framework like Electron to develop desktop apps.
                </p>
                <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of my recent projects have been a website, a little game, Pathfinding algorithms, 
                    and a python application that helps keep track of info for my Dungeons and Dragons Group.
                </p>
                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    My hobbies are programming (obviously), reading, watching TV, golfing, playing board games and card games, playing video games, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
                </p>
